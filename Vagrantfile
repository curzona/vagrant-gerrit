  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    # vb.gui = true
  
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "2048"]
	vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", 4]
  end
  
  # Provision the virtual environment
